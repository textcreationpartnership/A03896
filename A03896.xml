            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe truth when it hath ben hydden a longe tyme, com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth out at the length, the which hathe aproued trewe in theſe oure dayes as concernynge thynges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> belonge to relegion. For how the pope blynded oure fathers eyes it is not unknowen / and how many haue bene blinded in our dayes by wincheſters goſpels it nedith no probacyon. The whiche caſte ſuch a myſt before mens eyes that they were not able to diſcerne chal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke from cheſe. For when the lyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worde of God was taken from men, there was nothing left wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by theyr feates myghte be tryed whether they were of God or no. And to thentent that theyr drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes myght more commodiouſly crepe into mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience and not be utterly reiected, they threatned the people with ſic volo, ſit iubeo, and

But nowe (thankes be to God, whiche hath deliuered vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) theyr authorities, without the ſcripture is nothynge worth. For we haue nowe free paſſage to the ſcryptures, that we maye trye whether it be chaffe or corne, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his noynted ſhauelyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges haue taught vs. And where as God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them to ſpeake nothynge of theyr owne brayne, the moſt part that they taught is deuylyſhnes, and nothynge but deuylyſhnes, in ſomoch that that ſayenge of Chriſt in Mathewe is verefied of them. ye breake the or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinaunces of God to kepe youre owne tradicions. God ordayned that Chriſt ſhulde be a full and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonly ſacrifice for mans ſynnes, but they ſay no. God ſayth in Eſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ye, I alone haue troden the wyne preſſe, but they ſay no. And in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus,
<pb facs="tcp:4557:7"/>I am, I am, he my ſelfe whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che taketh away thyne iniquities and ſynnes for myne owne ſelues ſake, but they ſaye no. The Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les teacheth there is none other waye to be ſaued then by Chriſte, but they ſaye no. And why? mary (ſaye they) oure mother the holy churche whiche can not erre, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs that our maſſes are a ful ſacrifice ex opere operato for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quicke and the dead. Our mother the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly churche teacheth that men by gyuinge of veſtmentes, copes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtones, platers, croſſes chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cruettes, and ſuche other beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie, deſerue forgyuenes of ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and worſhip God. Our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holy church teacheth that the true worſhypynge of ſayntes is to cal vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to paynte their ymages, to ſet candels before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to bowe downe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and make them mediatours betwixte God

Therefore as often (good chriſten reader) as the authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che is layde agaynſte the, marke whether it be grounded vpon the ſcrypture or no, yf it be grounded vpon the ſcrypture receyueit, for Chriſte ſayth my ſhepe heare my voyce. But yf it be not, remembre what ſaynt Paule ſayth. yf we or an angell from heauen preached you a goſpell beſydes that we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue preached you, let him be acur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as we ſayd before. So I now ſaye agayne, yf any man preache you a goſpel beſydes that ye haue receyued let him be acurſed. Then yf he that teacheth an other goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell be acurſed, why ſhall not he be acurſed that receyue it? Relyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſhed therfore and forſake ſuche
